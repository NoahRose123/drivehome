2. **Firebase CLI** - Installed globally with `sudo`
3. **Firebase Functions** - Initialized in your project

## 🔑 Your SendGrid API Key

Your SendGrid API key is securely stored in:
- **Local:** `functions/.env` file (excluded from Git)
- **Cloud:** Firebase Functions environment variables

**Security Note:** Never commit API keys to Git. Always use environment variables or `.env` files that are excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

## 🚀 Your Live Cloud Function

**URL:** `https://sendverificationemail-yasr4ccbwq-uc.a.run.app`

This function is **deployed and ready** to send emails via SendGrid.

### How it works:

```javascript
// Your signup page sends a POST request:
fetch('https://sendverificationemail-yasr4ccbwq-uc.a.run.app', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
        email: 'user@example.com',
        code: '123456',
        firstName: 'John'
    })
});

// Cloud Function sends a professional email via SendGrid
// User receives email with verification code
```

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `.firebaserc` - Firebase project configuration
- `firebase.json` - Firebase deployment settings
- `functions/index.js` - Cloud Function code
- `functions/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `functions/.env` - SendGrid API key (local only, not in Git)

### Modified Files:

## 🔒 Security Notes

### What's Secure:
✅ API key stored in environment variables (not in code)  
✅ `.env` file excluded from Git via `.gitignore`  
✅ Cloud Function uses CORS for web requests  
✅ SendGrid handles email delivery securely  
✅ Verification codes generated on server-side  

### What to Know:
- The `.env` file contains your API key locally
- Firebase Functions config stores it in the cloud
- Never share your SendGrid API key publicly
- The API key in this file is for reference only
