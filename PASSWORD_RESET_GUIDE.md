## 📱 SMS Password Reset (Requires Backend)

### How It Works:
1. User clicks **"Forgot password?"** link on login page
2. Modal opens with two reset options
3. User selects **"SMS Verification"**
4. User enters their phone number (with country code)
5. reCAPTCHA verification appears
6. User completes reCAPTCHA
7. SMS code is sent to phone
8. User enters 6-digit code
9. User enters new password (twice)
10. Backend verifies code and updates password

### ⚠️ Important Note:
Firebase doesn't directly support SMS-based password reset. This requires:
1. **Firebase Cloud Functions** to handle SMS verification
2. **Backend API** to update user password after SMS verification
3. **Phone number linked** to user account in Firestore

### To Fully Implement SMS Reset:
You would need to create a Cloud Function like:

```javascript
// Firebase Cloud Function
exports.resetPasswordWithSMS = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
    const { phone, code, newPassword } = data;
    
    // Verify SMS code
    // Update user password
    // Return success/error
});
```
