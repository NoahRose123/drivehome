## 🔧 Firebase Console Setup (REQUIRED)

### 1. Enable Email/Password Authentication

1. Go to: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select: "chicken-project-2"
3. Navigate: **Authentication → Sign-in method**
4. Find: **Email/Password**
5. Click: Enable toggle
6. Click: **Save**

### 2. Enable Phone Authentication

1. In same **Sign-in method** page
2. Find: **Phone**
3. Click: Enable toggle
4. Click: **Save**

### 3. Update Firestore Security Rules

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX!**

Your current rules allow anyone to read/write your database!

1. Go to: **Firestore Database → Rules**
2. Replace with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Default: require authentication
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click: **Publish**

### 4. Verify Authorized Domains

1. Go to: **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**
2. Ensure these are listed:
   - ✅ `flockview.ca`
   - ✅ `chicken-project-2.firebaseapp.com`
   - ✅ `chicken-project-2.web.app`
   - ✅ `localhost` (for development)

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

2. Fill in:
   - First Name: "Test"
   - Last Name: "User"
   - Company Name: "Test Farm" (optional)
   - Email: your-real-email@example.com
   - Phone: +1-your-real-phone (with country code)
   - Password: At least 8 characters
   - Confirm Password: Same as above
   - ✓ Accept Terms
3. Click: "Send Verification Code"
4. Complete reCAPTCHA challenge
5. Check phone for SMS code
6. Enter code and click: "Create Account"
7. Should redirect to login page ✓

### Test Login Flow:

1. Visit: https://flockview.ca/login.html
2. Click: "Create Account" link → Should go to signup ✓
3. Use credentials you just created
4. Click: "Sign In"
5. Should redirect to main app ✓

## ⚠️ Known Localhost Issues (Expected)

When testing on localhost, you'll see these errors:

- ❌ `auth/requests-from-referer-http://127.0.0.1:5500-are-blocked`
  - **Why**: API key restrictions block localhost
  - **Fix**: Test on https://flockview.ca instead

- ❌ `403 Forbidden` on reCAPTCHA
  - **Why**: Phone Auth needs authorized domain
  - **Fix**: Works on production domain

- ❌ `auth/internal-error`
  - **Why**: Corrupted cache from previous sessions
  - **Fix**: Automatically clears and reloads (now fixed ✅)

**These errors are NORMAL on localhost and will NOT occur on flockview.ca!**

## 📋 User Data Structure

When a user signs up, this data is stored in Firestore:

```javascript
// Collection: users
// Document ID: {firebase-uid}
{
  uid: "firebase-user-id",
  email: "user@example.com",
  phone: "+1 555 123 4567",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  companyName: "Farm Company Inc", // or null if not provided
  displayName: "John Doe (Farm Company Inc)",
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  lastLogin: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  profileComplete: true
}
```

## 🔗 Important URLs

- **Signup**: https://flockview.ca/signup.html
- **Login**: https://flockview.ca/login.html
- **Main App**: https://flockview.ca/flockview-app-cursor-notoffical.html
- **Cache Cleaner**: https://flockview.ca/clear-firebase-cache.html

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Email already in use"
**Solution**: User already has an account. Use login page instead.

### Issue: "Phone number already exists"
**Solution**: Use different phone number or contact support.

### Issue: "Invalid verification code"
**Solution**: Code may be expired. Request a new code.

### Issue: "Phone authentication is not enabled"
**Solution**: Enable Phone provider in Firebase Console (see Step 2 above).

### Issue: Users can't login after signup
**Solution**: Check Firestore rules - they should allow authenticated users to read/write their own data.

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ User can access signup page from login page
