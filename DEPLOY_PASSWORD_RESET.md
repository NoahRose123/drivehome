## 📱 SMS Password Reset (UI Ready, Needs Backend)

### Current Status:

### To Fully Implement SMS Reset:

You would need to create a Firebase Cloud Function:

```javascript
// functions/index.js
const functions = require('firebase-functions');
const admin = require('firebase-admin');

exports.resetPasswordWithSMS = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
    const { phone, verificationCode, newPassword } = data;
    
    // Verify SMS code (Firebase Phone Auth)
    // Update user password in Firebase Auth
    // Return success/error
    
    return { success: true };
});
```

**For now, focus on email reset which is fully functional!**
